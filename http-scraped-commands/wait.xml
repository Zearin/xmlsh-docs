Waits for all jobs to complete, a specific job to complete, or at most N outstanding jobs to be running.<br/>
   <br/>
If job arguments are given they are interpreted as job ID's and waited for individually.<br/>
If no args are given then all jobs of the current shell are waited for.<br/>
If -m or -atmost is given then waits until there at atmost "n" jobs running.<br/>
   <br/>
Note that jobs most be known to the current shell.  waiting for "-m 10" is not a guarantee that there are at most 10 "threads" running, only that there are at most 10 "jobs invoked from the current shell" running.<br/>
