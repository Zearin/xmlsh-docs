   <h1>Command jcall</h1>

   
   <h3>Name</h3>

   <strong>jcall</strong> calls a java program (any class's static main) <br/>
   
   <h3>Synopsis</h3>

jcall [-cp,-classpath classpath ] classname [args]<br/>
   
   <h3>Description</h3>

Calls a java program from within the same JVM and thread as the current shell.<br/>
   <br/>
"classname" is the full package and class name, e.g. "org.xmlsh.commands.xpwd"<br/>
Args are optional arguments to be sent to called class.<br/>

   <h4>Options</h4>

   <table class="data">
      <tbody>
         <tr>
              <td>-cp,-classpath classpath</td>
              <td>Uses the specified classpath in the classloader for calling the specified class.  <br/>
The classpath is expected to be a single string or sequence of strings.</td>
            </tr>
      </tbody>
   </table>
   <br/>
This command simulates the equivalent call to "java" command line. <br/>
The class is attempted to be loaded, and the main function called with the supplied parameters.<br/>
   <br/>
Note, stdin and stdout are redirected to the shell's input and output, but stderr is not changed (remains the stderr of the calling environment, due to java limitations).<br/>

   <h4>Options to the Java virtual machine</h4>

   <br/>
Sometimes when you call up a Java application you need to pass parameters not to the program, but to the Java Virtual machine. The format for this is generally<br/>

   <div class="code">
      <pre>java  -X... -D... classname, application parameters</pre>
   </div>

the -X and -D parameters are not available to the jcall command. If that is what you need, use the java command, i.e. call out to the operating system, see <a  href="/BasicUsage">BasicUsage</a>
   <br/>
   
   <h3>Notes on classpath</h3>

If the classpath is more then one string it should be in a sequence variable or expression.<br/>
To pass this expression as a sequence you need to wrap it with {} to keep it from being expanded into seperate arguments.<br/>
   <br/>
   
   <h3>Examples</h3>

   <br/>
Example<br/>
   <div class="code">
      <pre>cp=(lib/*.jar)
jcall -cp {$cp} org.test.MyClass arg1 arg2 arg3</pre>
   </div>
